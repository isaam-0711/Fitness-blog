        "When you choose to live a healthy lifestyle, you
        not only do yourself a favor, but you set an excellent example for all of those
        around you. Your friends, family, and children are impacted by the healthy
        choices you make and will often feel inspired to make a change in their own
        lives.

        The result of this is better relationships, lower
        risk of disease, and an overall healthier and happier world. By simply making
        healthier choices, you can have a rippling impact on all of those around you.
        Be the person to start the change"

    <p>
        Health and fitness are about more than the way
        you look, the food you eat, or the weight you lift at the gym. They’re about:

        the way you feel.
        your quality of life.
        the focus you have at work.
        your ability to move.
        your psychological state.

        When you’re truly healthy, you are in a better mood and can physically do more. You can do things like walking
        your dog, going hiking, or paddleboarding. Not being able to do these things can drastically impact your
        experiences and limit your quality of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        I find that “diets” or “workout challenges” only
        last so long. It is unrealistic to be going at 100 MPH all the time. We are all
        human. Life happens, stress comes and goes, and schedules can get thrown off.
        When we choose to live a healthy lifestyle, we learn to accept these things and
        ADAPT.

        You learn to enjoy life when you are on vacation
        and away from your gym and kitchen because you have developed the habits and
        skills to live a healthy lifestyle no matter where you are. By always
        practicing moderation and balance, you allow yourself to indulge without going
        overboard. If you don't have access to a gym one week, you get in the habit of
        traveling with your resistant bands, creating a bodyweight circuit, or using
        nearby benches and stairs to get a workout in. You learn to adapt instead of
        self-destructing when your routine gets thrown off.

        A new study suggests moderate exercise is not just good for your body but improves mental health as well.
        Researchers concluded this after analyzing the responses of 1.2 million adults who participated in a Centers for
        Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) survey.

        Physical activity improves mental health

        The study, which appeared in the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet Psychiatry, examined survey results
        from 2011, 2013 and 2015. Researchers found that, on average, a person has 3.4 poor mental health days per
        month.

        But among those who exercise, the number of poor mental health days dropped by more than 40 percent. Exercise
        may change the way the brain functions, which could account for the decrease in depression or anxiety.

        The study describes “poor mental health” as:

        Mood-altering benefits of exercise

        After analyzing the results, researchers concluded that three to five 45-minute exercise sessions a week
        delivered optimal mental health benefits.

        It’s possible to get too much exercise and not see these benefits. At the three-hour exercise mark, people had
        worse mental health compared to the non-exercising population. Researchers hypothesize that those who favor
        marathon-length workouts may:
